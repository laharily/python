It was Toto that made Dorothy laugh, and saved her from growing as gray as
her other surroundings. Toto was not gray; he was a little black dog, with
long silky hair and small black eyes that twinkled merrily on either side
of his funny, wee nose. Toto played all day long, and Dorothy played with
him, and loved him dearly.
